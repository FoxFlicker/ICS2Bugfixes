# Internet Cafe Simulator 2 Bug Fixes

With the lack of updates for Internet Cafe Simulator 2, it's apparent that many of the game's bugs will forever cripple the experience.
I'll release new fixes as I find them. Feel free to report any bugs you'd like me to look at. I'm not great at this, but I'll do my best!

Side note: I'm familiar with the basics of Github, but that's about it. If something goes unnoticed or is done incorrectly, please let me know so I can correct it.
